dollop is a PoS-based cryptocurrency.

Development process
===========================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of dollop.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be 
labeled 'stale'.

Proof of Stake (POS): The dollop blockchain is a solution with the future in mind, non resource intensive mining that creates and even playing field and allows anyone to earn from supporting the network. The dollop desktop wallet is all you need to become a dollop "Producer" and start earning new coins in real time. POS is the next step in cryptocurrency evolution which promotes true decentralization by improving accessibility, we have removed the technical and expensive POW environment to allow anyone with a modern computer to earn from supporting the blockchain.

SMARTER TECHNOLOGY Impervious to typical attacks, the Credit blockchain completely ignores hash power and selects producers based on their balance. The absence of master nodes improves security by eliminating other forms of attack that are used in networks with fewer producers.

100% INCLUSIVE The dollop wallet is simple to install and produces blocks automatically, anyone with a modern computer can be setup in minutes. This increases the decentralization within the node community by making it simple and accessible with no coding or advanced skills required.

FAST & FREE Sending dollop takes seconds and is virtually free, any user can group unlimited unique transactions into a batch and send all the payments at once for the low fee of 0.00001 CREDIT. Transactions are confirmed quickly by the network of nodes that are rewarded with new coins rather than transaction fee's.

Innovation The end goal of proof-of-stake (PoS) is identical to that of proof-of-work (PoW), they both seek to validate transactions and achieve network consensus. Itâ€™s just their processes that are different.

The biggest advantage that POS has over POW is that it is much less energy intensive, because hash power plays no role in success as a producer. This solidifies the decentralization of the Credit blockchain by removing equipment cost and expertise barriers which allows us to welcome literally thousands of non-technical block producers. We believe that Credit's use of POS incentives for block producers are much more aligned with our community.
